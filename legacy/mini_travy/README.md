# Mini Travy (Archived)

The Mini Travy sprite rig toolkit and related patch scripts now live here. These
artifacts are preserved for backwards compatibility but are not part of the core
CharGen Studio application.

- `spriterig_v1_1.py` — original sprite rig CLI.
- `apply_patches_mintravy.py`, `patch_P004_globbing.py` — maintenance utilities.
- `minitravy/` and `plugins/` — plugin framework modules.
- `pyproject.toml` — packaging metadata for the archived toolchain.
