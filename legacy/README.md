# Legacy Assets

This folder archives historical Mini Travy sprite rig tooling that is no longer part of
CharGen Studio's supported workflow. Files are retained for reference but are excluded
from active maintenance.

Contents include the original `spriterig_v1_1.py` script, its patch utilities, and the
`minitravy` plugin system. Use at your own risk.
