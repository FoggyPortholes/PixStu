# Successor Note v1.9.4

## Feature Status
- Multi-LoRA blending UI ✅
- Persistent Cache v2 ✅
- Gallery cleanup & integration tests ✅

## Lessons Learned
- Persisting user-specific data under `.pixstu/` keeps the repo clean while
  still allowing CI to exercise the same code paths as end users.
- The inpainting cache benefits greatly from deterministic cache keys; make
  sure any future image processing keeps its pre-processing steps in lockstep
  with the key generation.
- Integration coverage that stubs heavy pipelines is a good compromise between
  execution time and regression protection.

## Self-Note
Remember to revisit the LoRA blend UI once we have feedback from artists; they
may want presets scoped per character type. Also verify that cache eviction
remains tuned once real assets are exercised on slower disks.
