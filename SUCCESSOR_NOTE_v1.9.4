## Lessons Learned
- Persisting user-specific data under `.pixstu/` keeps the repo clean while
  still allowing CI to exercise the same code paths as end users.
- The inpainting cache benefits greatly from deterministic cache keys; make
  sure any future image processing keeps its pre-processing steps in lockstep
  with the key generation.
- Integration coverage that stubs heavy pipelines is a good compromise between
  execution time and regression protection.

## Self-Note
Monitor LoRA registry growth—consider surfacing size estimates before download
and optionally exposing per-character presets once artists weigh in. Revisit
cache TTL defaults after gathering telemetry from slower disks.
